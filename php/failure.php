					Well, that could have been better. Before I	can let you try again or go try your luck at another tower, 
					you\'ll have to show me that you know at least something about phonetics and	phonology. I\'ll ask 
					you some questions, and once you get one of them right, you might go on and prove that you can do better 
					than you did just now.

					Oops! Apparently there were some things you couldnâ€™t solve correctly. Let\'s see whether you can do better 
					with some theoretical questions. Once you get one right, you might try the morpheme analysis again, or just 
					go to another tower first.

					I\'m sorry, but it looks like there are some mistakes to polish off. No worries! Let\'s try with some multiple 
					choice questions about syntax. Once you get a right answer, you can repeat the task!
